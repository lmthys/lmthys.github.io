<h1>Health Tracker Application</h1>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>This application is currently being developed by me in Software Engineering 490. This application is supposed  to be a health tracker. It will take into account fitness, food, sleep and overall pain. 
   Then it will use that information to generate a report to take to your doctor. It is being made in Visual Studio, using C#. </p>
