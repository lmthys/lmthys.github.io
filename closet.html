<h1>Pocket Closet Application</h1>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>This application was developed by me and three other team members in Computer Science 309. 
   The idea behind the project was to help the end user pick outfits efficiently and be able to publish and store their favorites.
   We did this by making an android application that would access the userâ€™s camera. 
   They would be instructed to take pictures of all their clothes. 
   When they would take a picture of an article of clothing our application would determine what the color of the item was. 
   Then the user would select the style, length, and what weather this piece would go well with. 
   After all pieces were uploaded the user could select their location to get accurate weather data, and then get an outfit of their clothes that was stylish and fit the weather. </p>
   
 <p>  To accomplish this application, I personally had to learn android studio, xml, Volley (Android Studio Library) , php, and server interaction. </p>
