<h1>Child Angular Application</h1>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>This project was developed by a partner and I in Computer Science 319. Our completed project, named “Alpha-Number Matcheroo,” provides four different games: two alphabet-oriented, two numbers-oriented. Each game is the same in the sense that they are all matching card games, similar to that of Concentration. However, there are two categories of games: Concentration and Association. In Concentration, the user simply has to match “A” to “A” or “0” to “0” depending on the version. Association, on the hand, requires the user to match the letter to a word, like “A” to “Anteater” or “0” to “Zero.”

<p> To accomplish this project we used, Laravel  and AngularJS.</p>
